Social distancing works but in its simplest form it is brutal and economically very damaging. We have already seen how tracing and testing can greatly improve it by applying social distancing at the right places, around infected people. Technology can help further. We need a social distancing approach that allows for our economies to re-start soon and be practiced easily for another 18-24 months, the probable time required for vaccine clinical trials and mass vaccination campaigns. At the same time, we want to avoid creating tools which can later be abused by governments and companies to track us and control us.


# The Idea:

Imagine that an app in your phone would keep track of the probability that you are infected based on where you have been and the encounters you made and would share that risk information with people you encounter so their app could update their own risk estimation. 
*We would also make an thermal scanner in the app which would monitor and update your risk status* ---- {this would require external thermal scanner hardware, for every device}

Imagine that when you encounter someone you would be able to tell how much risk of being infected they would carry, so you could choose to keep your distances or not let them enter your store, your house or your vehicle. Imagine that you would always be able to know your own risk level so that would make you more self-conscious of the risk you pose to others, inciting you to stay at home and wash your hands more often.

The peer-to-peer tracing would thus require no centralized database of everyoneâ€™s movement. Only the anonymized and delocalized data needed to train the predictor would be centralized, the crucial geographical information about who you encounter where and when would remain in your phone and only be communicated peer-to-peer. 

The app could also answer your questions about the disease and connect you with local health authorities to be tested.

It could use a daily check-up {via the thermal scanner} to verify that no new symptoms showed up and accordingly update your internal risk estimation. 

Since people you encounter and store owners would be able to know if you have the app (because the apps could talk to each other via bluetooth within 10 meters) there would be social pressure to upload the app in order to be able to move freely outside in places with other people. Governments could mandate having the app in order to access some locations holding more than a certain number of people, grocery stores, schools and universities, etc.
