Social distancing works but in its simplest form it is brutal and economically very damaging. We have already seen how tracing and testing can greatly improve it by applying social distancing at the right places, around infected people. Technology can help further. We need a social distancing approach that allows for our economies to re-start soon and be practiced easily for another 18-24 months, the probable time required for vaccine clinical trials and mass vaccination campaigns. At the same time, we want to avoid creating tools which can later be abused by governments and companies to track us and control us.

# The Idea:

## Part 1.) 
An app using optical heartbeat sensing would aquire your heartbeat rate, people can manualy enter their temperatures           via thermometer and enter their travel and contact histories, which all will be analysed by a Neural Network model          to predict a certain risk factor of your's.

## Part 2.) 

Imagine that an app in your phone would keep track of the probability that you are infected based on where you have          been and the encounters you made and would share that risk information with people you encounter so their app could           update their own risk estimation. 

   Imagine that when you encounter someone you would be able to tell how much risk of being infected they would carry, so you     could choose to keep your distances or not let them enter your store, your house or your vehicle. Imagine that you would      always be able to know your own risk level so that would make you more self-conscious of the risk you pose to others,         inciting you to stay at home and wash your hands more often.

   The peer-to-peer tracing (like the Happn dating app and Snapchat ) would thus require no centralized database of               everyone’s movement. Only the anonymized and delocalized data needed to train the predictor would be centralized, the         crucial geographical information about who you encounter where and when would remain in your phone and only be                communicated peer-to-peer.

## Part 3.)  
The app could also answer your questions about the disease and connect you with local health authorities to be                tested.

## Part 4.) 
A blockchain system can be introduced to keep an anonymous record (Like ethereum accounts) of all patients and if anyone finds you suspected , they could (basic rules : being either in a very close proximity to you always, being a doctor or being a relative) add a flag to you. If no of flags increase a ertain limit, only then (only) gov authorities) would have access to (only) your risk related data.

It could use a daily check-up {via the thermometer} to verify that no new symptoms showed up and accordingly update your internal risk estimation.

Since people you encounter and store owners would be able to know if you have the app (because the apps could talk to each other via bluetooth within 10 meters) there would be social pressure to upload the app in order to be able to move freely outside in places with other people. Governments could mandate having the app in order to access some locations holding more than a certain number of people, grocery stores, schools and universities, etc.

# *current threats:
1.) Your encounters while at the grocery store.
2.) The police/hospital personnel working.
3.) The maids/third class working in your homes have been extensively interacting with people(other houses).
